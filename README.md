# BIVY üèïÔ∏è

Welcome to Bivy! We're here to help you find your way to the perfect camping spot, so you can sleep under the stars and get some well-deserved R&R (roasting and relaxation).


## Usage

With Bivy, users can browse through dispersed camping sites across the West Coast. Click on a card image to reveal additional details about the campsite, including its gps coordinates, amenities, and more. Need to find a specific spot? Use our search function to find campsites by name, cost or any other keyword.

But wait, there's s'more! Our star feature lets you mark your favorite campsites for easy access later. And the best part? Your starred campsites will persist across your devices, so you can always find them when you need them. 

Feeling like a trailblazer? Submit new campsites and share your hidden gems with other Bivy users. Once approved, your campsite will be visible to all who use our app.

So what are you waiting for? Grab your gear, pack up the car, and let us guide you to the perfect camping spot. With Bivy in your back pocket, you're guaranteed to be a happy camper.
