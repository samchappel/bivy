      <p className="about-text">
        Camping on public lands away from developed recreation facilities is
        referred to as dispersed camping. Most of the remainder of public lands
        are open to dispersed camping, as long as it does not conflict with
        other authorized uses or in areas posted ‚Äúclosed to camping,‚Äù or in some
        way adversely affects wildlife species or natural resources. Dispersed
        camping is generally allowed on public land for a period not to exceed
        14 days within a 28 consecutive day period. Camping limitation rules
        vary per office, please check with your local office for details on
        camping limitations. In addition, campers must not leave any personal
        property unattended for more than 10 days

      <h3 className="about-subheading">How To Pick A Campsite</h3>
      <p className="about-text">
        If you are going to an area where others have camped before, pick a site
        that has been used before. Plants, soil and wildlife are impacted by new
        campsites so using existing ones will minimize your impact in the
        forest. If there is no existing campsite, then follow these Leave No
        Trace guidelines.
      </p>
      <ul className="about-list">
        <li className="about-list-item">
          Camp on bare soil if possible, to avoid damage or killing plants and
          grass.
        </li>
        <li className="about-list-item">
          Do <strong>NOT</strong> camp within 100 feet of any water source, plants near water are
          especially fragile.
        </li>
        <li className="about-list-item">
          Do not camp in the middle of a clearing or meadow; try to make your
          campsite less visible so that other visitors will see a ‚Äúwild‚Äù
          setting.
        </li>
        <li className="about-list-item">
          Do not try to level or dig trenches in the ground at your campsite.
          Pick a tent site that is already level with good drainage.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Regardless of where you are outside or what you're doing, üí© happens. But did you know that the
        improper disposal of human waste is a growing problem at our outdoor recreation
        areas? Human waste can contaminate water sources, spread disease, ruin
        other people's experience, and raise the alarm of land managers.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        Different areas require differing methods for human waste
        disposal, depending on the environment, local rules, and regulations.

      <ul className="about-list">
        <li className="about-list-item">Use toilets whenever possible, even if you have to hike a bit further.</li>
        <li className="about-list-item">
          Keep a few waste disposal bags in your pack for emergencies.
        </li>
        <li className="about-list-item">In popular, high-use areas, don't dig a hole. <strong>ALWAYS</strong> pack it out in your waste disposal bag.</li>
        <li className="about-list-item">In remote forested areas where it is appropriate to use a cat hole, dig a hole 8" deep by 4" wide and bury only your waste. Always pack out your toilet paper.</li>
        <li className="about-list-item">Always pack it out in a bag in desert and alpine areas. Both soils lack the microorganisms to break down human waste.</li>
        <li className="about-list-item">Whether you're going #1 or #2, move at least 200 feet away from water sources before doing your business.</li>
